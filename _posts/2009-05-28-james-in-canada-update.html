<p>Sorry for lack of updates I was really busy the past few weeks between finally graduating from college and moving into a new apartment. I am finally settled in so expect more updates and new gear from extent. My brother uploaded some new photos from his stay up in Canada check them out after the jump.<br />

<p>Needless to say the cabin looks amazing and log home building is a true art and skill. Check out some of the photos documenting the progress of the cabin build<br />
