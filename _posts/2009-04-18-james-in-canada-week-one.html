<p>James is settled in up in Canada and has begun his 10 week course in log home building. He has been having lots of fun and learning a lot he sent some photographs documenting his progress thus far and the pictures are amazing. Log home building is truly an art form and I am really psyched on what my brother James is doing check out the images after the jump.</p>
