<p>Joe Oshman recently made a trip out to Colorado to meet up with Craig Kleckner to camp, hike, and ride bikes. He did a little write up from his trip and sent some photos. View the story and photos after the jump.</p>

<div class="blockquote">My new Number #1 travel pal, Kaylan and I were fortunate enough to get out of work for the entire week before Memorial Day. Craig on the other hand was fortunate enough to be in the grace period before student loans kick in and had enough dough to swing a galactic sized road trip.  Long story short: we spot Craig in the headlights at 12midnight 9,500ft up a mountain after driving a thousand miles with no phone service.  Beers were cold, air was clean and the mountains Rocky.  I'm gonna recommend that if you never been to the Rockies and have the means: GO because every town has a sick free park, there is No humidity and people love bikes like bears love honey. Life is a highway.....<br />
