<p>I forgot I put this old video my myspace a couple of years ago most of the footage was from my senior year of high school and my first year of college which was around 2003. This was a time when the epic skatepark Studio 334 was still open, the majority of riders still had brakes, and all I did was ride bmx. Priorties have since changed but the love for bmx still feels the same as it did 6 years ago. </p>
