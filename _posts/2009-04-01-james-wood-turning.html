<p>Our grandfather recently gave us a Wood Lathe and James has been experimenting with it quite a bit lately. He has made several things already including a sweet rolling pin made out of walnut and he is now making some wooden cups. They turned out really amazing check out some photos of the "wood turning" process below. James never stops haha.</p>
