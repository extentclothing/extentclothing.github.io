<p>James just left the U.S. for 10 weeks. He will be living in the middle of woods in Canada for the next 10 weeks while he learns the ropes in the art of building log homes. We are super psyched for him. I am planning on having a small Extent camping expedition to go up and visit him. Also you may want to take notice to the object on his head it is a new product we are developing. Keep checking back for new product developments and what James is up to in Canada.</p>
