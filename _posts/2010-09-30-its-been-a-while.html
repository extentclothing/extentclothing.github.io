<p>2 updates in a week dang! Its been almost a year since I updated this thing lets see if we can keep it going. Continue reading for some more words and crew updates.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>Its crazy how much people's lives can change within a year but some things never change. I don't think I will never stop getting a kick out of riding trails or watching my brother ride trails for that matter. Here he is doing an unlookback over the backline at the Beury Patch currently dubbed "Harriet Tubman".</p>
<p>Also there has been some crew changes, upstate FBM shredder Joel Barnett no longer rides for us. He is a good old boy and was with us since we started this thing. He is still and will always be an awesome dude thanks for the support all those years man keep having fun.</p>
