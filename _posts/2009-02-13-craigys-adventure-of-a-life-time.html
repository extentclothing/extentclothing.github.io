<p>Craig Kleckner is going on a month long camping/kayaking trip through the Grand Canyon. Sounds like it would be a wild and amazing experience. Expect some interesting photos and storys when he returns.</p>
<div class="blockquote"> I will be leaving Philadelphia airport at 5:30 headed for Flagstaff AZ with two stops in between. I will be getting on the water Friday the 13th and kayaking the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. I will be getting off the water 275 miles and 21 days later. I will be home March 8th but until then I wish everyone the best.<br />
peace... CK

<p>Good luck bro have fun</p>
