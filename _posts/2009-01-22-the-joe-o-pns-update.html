<p>James, Craig and Joe Oshman went on a little trip out to Ohio this past weekend.<br />

<p>Not content with weekend tv shows or miserable central Pa weather, James H, Craig K and I packed up last Friday and ventured westbound.  We were enticed by stories of crazy ramps and fun times and had to check out Ray’s MTB first hand.  Neither Craig nor I have ever been to Ray’s and man were we blown out of our sneakers. The people behind Ray’s are either artists or mad scientist or both. </p>
<p>The session was a treat for all involved.  Pump tracks, box rhythms, bowls, logs, 2X4’s everything got the shred and the shred was good. To sum things up; James rode like Coach Ditka driving daa Bears bus- total domination.  The only thing about Craig that had more style than his riding is his holgan-stache, and I managed to pull off a few items of my own.  All and all it was another awesome road trip with good pals and dang it that’s the best part of riding. </p>
